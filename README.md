# Mystery Puzzle

#### Behavior-driven development independent project

#### by Garrett Biernat 4/22
## Description
a simple Java web application that takes the user input in the form of a sentence and then replaces all the vowels in it with a dash so that someone else can guess what the mystery sentence is. But if they get stuck that can click hint and a random letter will be revealed but for every letter revealed you loose 4 points so if you reveal all the letters you loose entirely.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone repository,
* Install gradle
* enter "gradle run" in the repositories directory
* in your browser go to "localhost:4567"
* enter a sentence into the fields, and click
* try and guess what the word is from only consonants
* if you guess wrong, try again, if you guess correctly, enter a new word.

## Known Bugs
Not entirely sure about filling hidden input fields just to get the value I assume theres a better way to do that but it was the only way that I had found to make this work.

## Technologies Used
* Velocity Template Engine
* Spark
* Java
* Gradle
